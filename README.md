A simple script for QBCore, QBox & ESX to show your vehicle's mileage in-game. When driving a vehicle that is owned (stored in the database), you will see an odometer in the bottom right of your screen. You can configure it to use miles or kilometers.

## Installation

## Custom Framework

If you not using QBCore, Qbox or ESX and are instead running a different framework, a custom one, or no framework at all, NeoFive Vehicle Mileage is pretty straightforward to adapt. We have written a guide in our docs: https://neofive.gitbook.io/docs/vehicle-mileage/custom-framework
